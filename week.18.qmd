Welcome to your overview of the materials you will work with in **PSYC122 Week 18**.

We will complete four classes in weeks 16-19.
These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.

We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the **Clearly understood** project.

- Our focus will be on **what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information**.

::: callout-important
In the week 18 class, we will aim to answer **two research questions**:

1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?
2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written
:::

## Our learning goals

In Week 18, we aim to further develop skills in *analyzing* and in *visualizing* psychological data.

We will use linear models to estimate the association between predictors and outcomes.
What is new, here, is that we will explore the power and flexibility of the linear model analysis method in two important aspects.

::: callout-tip
1. We will fit linear models including *multiple* predictors, this is why this form of analysis is also often called *multiple regression*.
2 We will use linear models to estimate the effects of numeric and categorical or nominal predictor variables.
:::

When we do these analyses, we will need to adapt how we report the results:  

- we need to report information about the model we specify, identifying *all* predictors;
- we will need to decide if the effects of one or more predictors are significant;
- we will report the model fit statistics (`F, R-squared`) as well as coefficient estimates;
- and we need to learn to write texts *describing* the impact of predictors.

Usually, in describing the impacts of predictors, we are required to communicate:

- the direction of the effect -- do values of the outcome variable *increase* or *decrease* given increasing values of the predictor?
- the size of the effect -- *how much* do values of the outcome variable *increase* or *decrease* given increasing values of the predictor?

This task of description is enabled by producing plots of the predictions we can make:

- about how we expect the outcome to change, given different values of a predictor.

::: callout-tip
We will aim to build skills in producing professional-looking plots for our audiences.

- We can produce plots showing the effects of predictors
- As predictions of change in outcome, given different values of the predictor variables.

## Lectures: video recordings

The lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts.

Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the *Panopto* video for the lecture part.
(You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)

[Part 1 of 4; about 19 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7ae0e020-8dcc-436e-9d69-afb700ca1a52)

[Part 2 of 4; about 13 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d2638334-4683-4543-8183-afb700cfbff0)

[Part 3 of 4; about 15 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=68e5cba9-ea96-4788-9c21-afb700d3ba29)

[Part 4 of 4; about 13 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0f6ba49d-f54d-41d0-ab30-afb700d84744)

The lectures have three main areas of focus.

**1. Working with the linear model with multiple predictors**

We focus in-depth on how you code linear models, how you identify critical information in the results summaries, and how you report the results: the language and the style you can use in your reports.

::: callout-tip
- A small change to `lm()` coding releases power and flexibility in how you use the analysis method.
:::

**2. Analyses are done in context so when we conduct analyses we must use contextual information**

The power and flexibility of the linear model presents challenges.
We must decide *which* predictor variables we specify in our model.
This specification requires us to think about our theoretical assumptions and what they require us to include to make sense of the behaviours or the individual differences we observe when we do things like investigating what makes health information easy or difficult to understand.

**3. Developing critical thinking**

As we develop conceptual understanding and practical skills, we must learn to reflect critically on our analyses, and learn to critically evaluate the analyses we read about when we read research reports in the scientific literature.

::: callout-tip
*Critical analysis* can develop by considering

- validity
- measurement
- generalizability
:::

We are always working in the broader context of uncertainty:

- uncertainty about the predictions we may make concerning outcomes of interest;
- uncertainty given the possibility that predicted effects may vary between individuals or groups;
- uncertainty given the influence of sources of randomness in how specific responses are produced.

### Links to other classes

In the lecture, I sketch out the ways that the linear model can be extended. You will learn new and different analysis methods in the second year classes but, most of the time, you may understand that ...

::: callout-important
*Everything* is some kind of linear model.

## Pre-lab activity 1

In weeks 16-19, we have been working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.

Completing the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.

To enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.

Complete the survey by clicking on the link [here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SDgBLz8RrMR3oy)

::: callout-warning
In our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.

- This means we will **close the survey** by 5pm Monday 6 March (week 18)
:::

### Pre-lab activity 1 alternative

If you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.

[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)

## Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class

### Get your files ready {#sec-w18-resources}

Download the [122-22-w18_for-students.zip](files/122-22-w18_for-students.zip) files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server.

The folder includes the data files:

- `study-one-general-participants.csv`
- `study-two-general-participants.csv`

and the *code files*:

- `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-how-to.R`
- `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-workbook.R`

You will use `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-workbook.R` in the lab activity practical class.

*Alternatively*, you can instead download the resources you need from the week 18 section of the Moodle page for the PSYC122 module:

[Link to Moodle](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38180#section-10)

#### What is in the how-to and workbook.R files?

::: callout-important
- Our aim is to make sure you can work with code, and write notes *in* the .R files.
:::

In the `workbook.R` file you use for the lab activity, we identify tasks and questions, and leave you spaces where you can write code or answers.

In both the .R files:

- `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-how-to.R`
- `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-workbook.R`

we will take things *step-by-step*.

::: callout-tip
- Make sure you start at the top of the `.R` file and work your way, in order, through each task.
- Complete each task before you move on to the next task.
:::

The `how-to` guide comprises an .R file `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-how-to.R` with code and advice.
The code in the .R file was written to work with the data file:

- `study-one-general-participants.csv`.

::: callout-tip
We show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (@sec-w18-activity) in the `how-to` guide.

- Start by looking at the `how-to` guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.
:::

## Lab activity {#sec-w18-activity}

In the lab activity .R file `2022-23-PSYC122-w18-workbook.R`, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics):

- `study-two-general-participants.csv`

The data are similar in format to the response data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project.

### Tasks

In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.

1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`
2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`
3. Read in the data files -- using `read_csv()`
4. Inspect the data -- using `head()` and `summary()`
5. Estimate the way in which an outcome may vary, given different values in a predictor variable -- using  `lm()`
6. Do this with multiple predictor variables
7. Better understand linear model predictions by comparing one outcome-predictor relation
8. Create boxplots to examine the potential association between variation in a continuous outcome variable and the differences between groups or levels in a categorical variable -- using `geom_boxplot()`
9. Estimate the effects of factors as well as numeric variables
10. Visualize the model predictions -- using `ggpredict()`

The activity `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-activity.R` file takes you through the tasks, one by one.

If you are unsure about what you need to do, check in the `how-to` guide: look at the advice in `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R` or watch the accompanying video.

You will see that you can match a task in the `activity` to the same task in the `how-to`.
The `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.
You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.

This process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science.

### What is in the data files

Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.

You can see the columns:

- `participant_ID` participant code
- `mean.acc` average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance
- `mean.self` average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance
- `study` varianble coding for what study the data were collected in
- `AGE` age in years
- `HLVA` health literacy test score
- `SHIPLEY` vocabulary knowledge test score
- `FACTOR3` reading strategy survey score
- `GENDER` gender code
- `EDUCATION` education level code
- `ETHNICITY` ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code

### Answers

You will be able to download the answers version of the activity .R file in week 18.
The answers version will present my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful.
