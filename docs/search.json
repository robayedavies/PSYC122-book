    "text": "Welcome to our overview of the materials and activities you will work with in PSYC122 Part 2.\nWe will complete a series of four classes which will run in weeks 16-19.\nThe classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will reference lectures in these other modules where you may benefit from connecting ideas about research integrity and open science to your critical thinking on what we are doing.\n\n\n\n\nIn weeks 16-20, we are going to focus on working in research in context (see Figure Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nreading\n\n reading   \n\nknowledge\n\n knowledge   \n\nreading–knowledge\n\n   \n\nconventions\n\n conventions   \n\nknowledge–conventions\n\n   \n\nconcepts\n\n concepts   \n\nknowledge–concepts\n\n   \n\npractices\n\n practices   \n\nknowledge–practices\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 1: This is a simple graphviz graph.\n\n\n\n\nYou have been introduced to R. We know that some of you are new to R so we will practice the skills you are learning. We will consolidate, revise, and extend these skills.\nWe will build your understanding of the linear model.\nThe big change is this focus on the context. The reason is that not talking about the context risks limiting how you approach, do or think about data analysis.\nIn traditional methods teaching, the schedule of classes will progress through a series of tests, one test a week, from simpler to more complex tests (e.g., from t-test to multiple regression at the undergraduate level). Textbooks often mirror this structure, presenting one test per chapter.\nIn this approach, the presentation is often brief about the context: the question the researchers are investigating; the methods they use to collect data, including the measurements; and the assumptions they make about how your reasoning can get you from the things you measure to the things you are trying to understand. In this approach, also, example data may be presented in a limited, partial, way.\nThe reasons for this are understandable: methods are complex, technical, subjects for learning, and teachers and students do not also have time, perhaps, to think about statistics and about theoretical or measurement assumptions.\nThis is risky because it presents a misleading view of the challenge in learning methods: the misleading view is that the challenge is just the (difficult enough) challenge of learning about statistical methods, or dealing with numbers. It is risky, also, because it implies that if you learn the method, and can match the textbook example – the variables, the state of the data – when it is your turn to do an analysis, all will be well.\nA more productive approach – this is the approach we will take – is to expose, and talk about some of the real challenges that anybody who handles data, or quantitative evidence, in professional life. These challenges include:\n\nThinking about the mapping from our concerns to the research questions, to the things we measure, to analysis we do, and then the conclusions we make.\nSelecting or constructing valid measures that can be assumed to measure the things they are supposed to measure.\nTaking samples of observations, and making conclusions about the population.\nMaking estimates and linking these estimates to an account that is explicit about causes."

These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\nWe will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the Clearly understood project.\nWe encounter written health information all the time: in warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about. It is not always easy to understand this information. The problem is that it is unclear how health information should be communicated. As psychologists, we can help to improve health communication.\nWe will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this context will help you to make sense of the data, and to see why we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching.\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. This is to give you the opportunity to revise and consolidate your learning. We will extend your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.\nUltimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together. These new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future."

    "text": "2.3 Lectures: video recordings\nThe lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part. (You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)\nPart 1 of 4; about 19 minutes\nPart 2 of 4; about 11 minutes\nPart 3 of 4; about 9 minutes\nPart 4 of 4; about 15 minutes\nThe lectures have two main areas of focus.\n1. Understanding the scientific process\nI outline the steps through which a psychological scientist may progress, in logic and practice, from research questions to hypotheses to analyses.\nI rehearse some of the key points I have discussed, previously, in order to build a framework in which you can understand how we go from:\n\na set of concerns – here: What makes it easy or difficult to understand written health information?\nthrough choices about what data to collect, and how\nto specific questions, and then predictions\nthat we can test using linear models.\n\nWe are learning data analysis methods. But the key point is that we use these methods in the context of a research project with concerns, aims, methodological assumptions, and choices. This is generally true so the aim is to present a concrete example of how research works.\nAs part of the discussion, I raise questions you might want to consider. These questions – and questions you can originate for yourselves – are also part of the context for our data analysis, because they help to inform how you interpret or evaluate the results. These questions are examples of the critical evaluation that you will need to develop through your studies.\n2. The linear model\nWe look at how the linear model can be used to address research questions in the context of the Clearly understood health comprehension project. But I aim to outline some general ideas about why we use the linear model technique, and how it works. I build on work you have done with Margriet Groen in earlier PSYC122 classes, so that we can strengthen understanding, and extend skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo work with the recordings:\n\nWatch the video parts right through.\nUse the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\nTry out the coding exercises in the how-to and the workbook (see Section 2.4.1) to see for yourself how you can construct visualizations and do analyses.\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how we use the linear model to estimate the association between (1.) an outcome like mean accuracy of understanding and (2.) a predictor like vocabulary knowledge: estimating the association as the expected change in the average outcome given variation in the predictor.\nIn the plot on the right of Figure 2.1, we show the distribution curve of mean (comprehension) accuracy scores observed at each value of vocabulary. You can see that the middle – the average – of each distribution, marked by a line, increases as we go from left (low scores) to right (high scores).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Plots showing the association between the outcome mean accuracy of understanding a predictor, vocabulary knowledge. Both plots show the same data. The plot on the right is modified to show how accuracy of understanding varies between individuals in the sample with the sample vocabulary test scores\n\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how the information we get from a linear model allows us to predict the way in which outcome values may vary (increase or decrease), given different values in the predictor variable.\nWe could form a prediction line anywhere but the linear model helps us to estimate the prediction (“best fit”) line that minimizes the differences between observed and predicted outcomes: the residuals, as shown in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Plot showing the prediction of mean accuracy of understanding, given information about participant vocabulary knowledge, with lines drawn to show the difference between observed outcomes (shown in orange-red) and predicted outcomes (shown as black circles on the blue line) for each vocabulary test score value in our sample\n\n\n\n\nThe lectures end with a discussion of the critical information you must identify and extract when you view the summary of a linear model results.\nI then show you how to report the results. I give you examples of the conventional language you can use to report your results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn reporting linear model results, we need to explain what they tell us about the association between outcome and predictor variables.\n\n\nWe can use visualization to help us to interpret the model estimates. In the how-to guide and in the lab activity workbook (see Section 2.4.1), we look at how you can draw prediction plots, given model estimates.\n\n2.3.1 Links to other classes\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about, in PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\nThe lectures in PSYC123 on: (week 2) reliability and validity; (week 3) experimental design, especially between-subjects studies and individual differences; and (week 9) precise hypotheses.\nThe lecture in PSYC122 (week 13) introducing the linear model.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Pre-lab activity 1\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Survey information\nThe survey asks you to:\n\ncomplete some questions about who you are;\nand then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.\n\nThe survey then asks you to:\n\nread five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;\nrespond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;\nand rate how well you think you understand the advice.\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.

    "text": "3.1 Welcome\nWelcome to your overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in PSYC122 Week 19.\nWe will complete four classes in weeks 16-19. These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC122, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\nWe will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the Clearly understood project. Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information. In these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions:\n\nWhat person attributes predict success in understanding?\nCan people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?\n\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. And we will be extending your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.\nI have said that, ultimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together. That time is now. The PSYC122 health comprehension survey is now closed, and we will focus the activity in our work in practical classes on analyzing the data we have collected.\nThe results of our analyses of these new data will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future."

And, as we work, we will also practise how we can ensure that the code we write to do data analysis is reproducible, and shareable. This is about open science good practice. And it is about getting ready for professional team working."

As we do this, we should reflect on where the data come from – the choices made on data collection – and we should consider, critically, questions concerning key ideas:\n\nMethods reproducibility – Will a different researcher be able to get the same results if they analyze the same data?\nResults reproducibility – Will we get the same results if we collect new data using the same procedure?\n\nThese questions are part of our motivation for recommending open science practices.\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Working with the linear model with multiple predictors\nWe focus in-depth on how you code linear models, how you identify critical information in the results summaries, and how you report the results: the language and the style you can use in your reports.\n\n\n3.4.1.3 The implications of our results, the revolution in open science and being part of it\nLast, we set up questions for you to consider:\n\nWhat are the results of our analyses with the new data?\nWhat are the implications for health communication?\n\nThen we step back, and consider how we are learning to work in terms of the modern workflow, and the on-going revolution in open science, and how people now build and share knowledge."
