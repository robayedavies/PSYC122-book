    "text": "Welcome to our overview of the materials and activities you will work with in PSYC122 Part 2.\nWe will complete a series of four classes which will run in weeks 16-19.\nThe classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will reference lectures in these other modules where you may benefit from connecting ideas about research integrity and open science to your critical thinking on what we are doing.\n\n\n\n\nIn weeks 16-20, we are going to focus on working in research in context (see Figure Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nreading\n\n reading   \n\nknowledge\n\n knowledge   \n\nreading–knowledge\n\n   \n\nconventions\n\n conventions   \n\nknowledge–conventions\n\n   \n\nconcepts\n\n concepts   \n\nknowledge–concepts\n\n   \n\npractices\n\n practices   \n\nknowledge–practices\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 1: This is a simple graphviz graph.\n\n\n\n\nYou have been introduced to R. We know that some of you are new to R so we will practice the skills you are learning. We will consolidate, revise, and extend these skills.\nWe will build your understanding of the linear model.\nThe big change is this focus on the context. The reason is that not talking about the context risks limiting how you approach, do or think about data analysis.\nIn traditional methods teaching, the schedule of classes will progress through a series of tests, one test a week, from simpler to more complex tests (e.g., from t-test to multiple regression at the undergraduate level). Textbooks often mirror this structure, presenting one test per chapter.\nIn this approach, the presentation is often brief about the context: the question the researchers are investigating; the methods they use to collect data, including the measurements; and the assumptions they make about how your reasoning can get you from the things you measure to the things you are trying to understand. In this approach, also, example data may be presented in a limited, partial, way.\nThe reasons for this are understandable: methods are complex, technical, subjects for learning, and teachers and students do not also have time, perhaps, to think about statistics and about theoretical or measurement assumptions.\nThis is risky because it presents a misleading view of the challenge in learning methods: the misleading view is that the challenge is just the (difficult enough) challenge of learning about statistical methods, or dealing with numbers. It is risky, also, because it implies that if you learn the method, and can match the textbook example – the variables, the state of the data – when it is your turn to do an analysis, all will be well.\nA more productive approach – this is the approach we will take – is to expose, and talk about some of the real challenges that anybody who handles data, or quantitative evidence, in professional life. These challenges include:\n\nThinking about the mapping from our concerns to the research questions, to the things we measure, to analysis we do, and then the conclusions we make.\nSelecting or constructing valid measures that can be assumed to measure the things they are supposed to measure.\nTaking samples of observations, and making conclusions about the population.\nMaking estimates and linking these estimates to an account that is explicit about causes."

These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\nWe will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the Clearly understood project.\nWe encounter written health information all the time: in warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about. It is not always easy to understand this information. The problem is that it is unclear how health information should be communicated. As psychologists, we can help to improve health communication.\nWe will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this context will help you to make sense of the data, and to see why we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching.\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. This is to give you the opportunity to revise and consolidate your learning. We will extend your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.\nUltimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together. These new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future."

    "text": "2.3 Lectures: video recordings\nThe lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part. (You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)\nPart 1 of 4; about 19 minutes\nPart 2 of 4; about 11 minutes\nPart 3 of 4; about 9 minutes\nPart 4 of 4; about 15 minutes\nThe lectures have two main areas of focus.\n1. Understanding the scientific process\nI outline the steps through which a psychological scientist may progress, in logic and practice, from research questions to hypotheses to analyses.\nI rehearse some of the key points I have discussed, previously, in order to build a framework in which you can understand how we go from:\n\na set of concerns – here: What makes it easy or difficult to understand written health information?\nthrough choices about what data to collect, and how\nto specific questions, and then predictions\nthat we can test using linear models.\n\nWe are learning data analysis methods. But the key point is that we use these methods in the context of a research project with concerns, aims, methodological assumptions, and choices. This is generally true so the aim is to present a concrete example of how research works.\nAs part of the discussion, I raise questions you might want to consider. These questions – and questions you can originate for yourselves – are also part of the context for our data analysis, because they help to inform how you interpret or evaluate the results. These questions are examples of the critical evaluation that you will need to develop through your studies.\n2. The linear model\nWe look at how the linear model can be used to address research questions in the context of the Clearly understood health comprehension project. But I aim to outline some general ideas about why we use the linear model technique, and how it works. I build on work you have done with Margriet Groen in earlier PSYC122 classes, so that we can strengthen understanding, and extend skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo work with the recordings:\n\nWatch the video parts right through.\nUse the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\nTry out the coding exercises in the how-to and the workbook (see Section 2.4.1) to see for yourself how you can construct visualizations and do analyses.\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how we use the linear model to estimate the association between (1.) an outcome like mean accuracy of understanding and (2.) a predictor like vocabulary knowledge: estimating the association as the expected change in the average outcome given variation in the predictor.\nIn the plot on the right of Figure 2.1, we show the distribution curve of mean (comprehension) accuracy scores observed at each value of vocabulary. You can see that the middle – the average – of each distribution, marked by a line, increases as we go from left (low scores) to right (high scores).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Plots showing the association between the outcome mean accuracy of understanding a predictor, vocabulary knowledge. Both plots show the same data. The plot on the right is modified to show how accuracy of understanding varies between individuals in the sample with the sample vocabulary test scores\n\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how the information we get from a linear model allows us to predict the way in which outcome values may vary (increase or decrease), given different values in the predictor variable.\nWe could form a prediction line anywhere but the linear model helps us to estimate the prediction (“best fit”) line that minimizes the differences between observed and predicted outcomes: the residuals, as shown in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Plot showing the prediction of mean accuracy of understanding, given information about participant vocabulary knowledge, with lines drawn to show the difference between observed outcomes (shown in orange-red) and predicted outcomes (shown as black circles on the blue line) for each vocabulary test score value in our sample\n\n\n\n\nThe lectures end with a discussion of the critical information you must identify and extract when you view the summary of a linear model results.\nI then show you how to report the results. I give you examples of the conventional language you can use to report your results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn reporting linear model results, we need to explain what they tell us about the association between outcome and predictor variables.\n\n\nWe can use visualization to help us to interpret the model estimates. In the how-to guide and in the lab activity workbook (see Section 2.4.1), we look at how you can draw prediction plots, given model estimates.\n\n2.3.1 Links to other classes\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about, in PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\nThe lectures in PSYC123 on: (week 2) reliability and validity; (week 3) experimental design, especially between-subjects studies and individual differences; and (week 9) precise hypotheses.\nThe lecture in PSYC122 (week 13) introducing the linear model.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Pre-lab activity 1\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Survey information\nThe survey asks you to:\n\ncomplete some questions about who you are;\nand then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.\n\nThe survey then asks you to:\n\nread five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;\nrespond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;\nand rate how well you think you understand the advice.\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.

Working with the linear model with multiple predictors\nWe focus in-depth on how you code linear models, how you identify critical information in the results summaries, and how you report the results: the language and the style you can use in your reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nA small change to lm() coding releases power and flexibility in how you use the analysis method.\n\n\n\n2. Analyses are done in context so when we conduct analyses we must use contextual information\nThe power and flexibility of the linear model presents challenges. We must decide which predictor variables we specify in our model. This specification requires us to think about our theoretical assumptions and what they require us to include to make sense of the behaviours or the individual differences we observe when we do things like investigating what makes health information easy or difficult to understand.\n3. Developing critical thinking\nAs we develop conceptual understanding and practical skills, we must learn to reflect critically on our analyses, and learn to critically evaluate the analyses we read about when we read research reports in the scientific literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCritical analysis can develop by considering\n\nvalidity\nmeasurement\ngeneralizability\n\n\n\nWe are always working in the broader context of uncertainty:\n\nuncertainty about the predictions we may make concerning outcomes of interest;\nuncertainty given the possibility that predicted effects may vary between individuals or groups;\nuncertainty given the influence of sources of randomness in how specific responses are produced.\n\n\n3.3.1 Links to other classes\nIn the lecture, I sketch out the ways that the linear model can be extended. You will learn new and different analysis methods in the second year classes but, most of the time, you may understand that …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEverything is some kind of linear model."

Thinking critically about how people vary, and about the robustness and generalizability of results in psychological science\nWe shall proceed to answer our research questions with the data we have collected with the help of PSYC122 students. As we do this, we should reflect on where the data come from – the fact that people vary, and results vary – and we should consider, critically, questions concerning key ideas:\n\nMethods reproducibility – Will a different researcher be able to get the same results if they analyze the same data?\nResults reproducibility – Will we get the same results if we collect new data using the same procedure?\n\nThese questions are part of our motivation for recommending open science practices.\n2. What the PSYC122 data tell us: the possible answers to our research questions\nWe have been working to develop understanding and skills using example questions, tasks and data developed within the health comprehension Clearly understood project. PSYC122 students contributed their responses to a version of the survey we have been using to collect data to find answers to our research questions. In our practical work, we will be examining the PSYC122 data but as we do so we should understand that no one study in psychological science will give us definitive answers to any interesting question about people and what they do. In the lecture, we reflect on how data from different studies – using the same methods, with the same aims – may nevertheless vary:\n\nvary in the data distributions\nand vary in the results that analyses indicate.\n\nCritically evaluating results across a series of studies, or replication attempts, is part of the process of accumulating evidence to build insight in psychological science, given measurement under uncertainty and limits in our samples.\n3. Growing in independence, working with free open R\nR is free open source software. This is critical to ensuring that when we do analyses with psychological data we can usefully share data and code in ways that help to build evidence and insight in psychological science.\nBut there is a bigger benefit: the vast, free, R knowledge ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEvery problem you ever have:\n\nsomeone has had it before\nsolved it\nand written a blog (or tweet or toot) or recorded a YouTube or TikTok about it\n\n\n\nIn the week 19 lecture, and in the practical materials, we start to look at how you can locate and use the information you need to do data analysis. But it is important that you recognize two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nEverything you need is out there, you just need to learn how to find it.\nSharing knowledge about R represents a new way to share scientific information: maybe this – not books or journals – is the future.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 The lectures: the implications of our results, the revolution in open science and being a part of the revolution\nLast, we set up questions for you to consider:\n\nWhat are the results of our analyses with the new data?\nWhat are the implications for health communication?\n\nThen we step back, and consider how we are learning to work in terms of the modern workflow, and the on-going revolution in open science, and how people now build and share knowledge."

    "text": "4.5 Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\n4.5.1 Get your files ready\nDownload the 122-22-w19_for-students.zip files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server.\nThe folder includes the data files:\n\nstudy-one-general-participants.csv\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv\n\nAs well as the data compiled from 2022-23 PSYC122 students\n\n2022-23_PSYC122-subjects.csv\n\nAs well as the code files:\n\n2022-23-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R\n2022-23-PSYC122-w19-workbook.R\n\nYou will use 2022-23-PSYC122-w19-workbook.R in the lab activity practical class.\nAlternatively, you can instead download the resources you need from the week 189 section of the Moodle page for the PSYC122 module:\nLink to Moodle\n\n4.5.1.1 What is in the how-to and workbook.R files?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nOur aim is to make sure you can work with code, and write notes in the .R files.\n\n\n\nIn the workbook.R file you use for the lab activity, we identify tasks and questions, and leave you spaces where you can write code or answers.\nIn both the .R files:\n\n2022-23-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R\n2022-23-PSYC122-w19-workbook.R\n\nwe will take things step-by-step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you start at the top of the .R file and work your way, in order, through each task.\nComplete each task before you move on to the next task.\n\n\n\nThe how-to guide comprises an .R file 2022-23-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R with code and advice. The code in the .R file was written to work – this week – with two data files:\n\nstudy-one-general-participants.csv.\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv.\n\nThis is so that you can learn how to:\n\nanalyse data from more than one study;\ncompare the results from the analyses of data from different studies to assess the robustness or generalizability of findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (Section 4.6) in the how-to guide.\n\nStart by looking at the how-to guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity."

    "text": "4.6 Lab activity\nIn the lab activity .R file 2022-23-PSYC122-w19-workbook.R, you will work with data from two studies about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics):\n\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv which you have already seen before;\n2022-23_PSYC122-subjects.csv which is new, comprising the responses contributed by 2022-23 PSYC122 students.\n\n\n4.6.1 Tasks\nIn the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.\n\nEmpty the R environment – using rm(list=ls())\nLoad relevant libraries – using library(): notice we use some new ones here\nRead in the data files – using read_csv()\nInspect the data – using head() and summary()\nPlot the distributions of some key variables\nLearn how to produce grids of plots, showing them side-by-side, for easy comparison\nWork to produce grids of plots to consolidate skills\nProduce scatterplots to examine potential associations\nProduce grids of scatterplots, showing them side-by-side to allow comparison of potential associations\nExamine the association between accuracy of understanding and rated accuracy using cor.test()\nWork out how to locate useful online information about R functions or libraries\nEstimate the way in which an outcome may vary, given different values in a predictor variable – using lm()\nDo this analysis using the 2022-23 PSYC122 data, and evaluate the robustness of results across a series of studies\nPractise visualizing model predictions using ggpredict()\n\nThe 2022-23-PSYC122-w19-workbook.R file takes you through the tasks, one by one.\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, check in the how-to guide: look at the advice in 2022-23-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R.\nYou will see that you can match a task in the activity to the same task in the how-to. The how-to shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code. You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.\nThis process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science.\n\n\n4.6.2 What is in the data files\nEach of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.\nYou can see the columns:\n\nparticipant_ID participant code\nmean.acc average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance\nmean.self average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance\nstudy varianble coding for what study the data were collected in\nAGE age in years\nHLVA health literacy test score\nSHIPLEY vocabulary knowledge test score\nFACTOR3 reading strategy survey score\nGENDER gender code\nEDUCATION education level code\nETHNICITY ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can now download the answers version of the activity workbook .R here.\n\n\nThe answers version presents my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful."
