    "text": "Welcome to our overview of the materials and activities you will work with in PSYC122 Part 2.\nWe will complete a series of four classes which will run in weeks 16-19.\nThe classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will reference lectures in these other modules where you may benefit from connecting ideas about research integrity and open science to your critical thinking on what we are doing.\n\n\n\n\nIn weeks 16-20, we are going to focus on working in research in context (see Figure Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nreading\n\n reading   \n\nknowledge\n\n knowledge   \n\nreading–knowledge\n\n   \n\nconventions\n\n conventions   \n\nknowledge–conventions\n\n   \n\nconcepts\n\n concepts   \n\nknowledge–concepts\n\n   \n\npractices\n\n practices   \n\nknowledge–practices\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 1: This is a simple graphviz graph.\n\n\n\n\nYou have been introduced to R. We know that some of you are new to R so we will practice the skills you are learning. We will consolidate, revise, and extend these skills.\nWe will build your understanding of the linear model.\nThe big change is this focus on the context. The reason is that not talking about the context risks limiting how you approach, do or think about data analysis.\nIn traditional methods teaching, the schedule of classes will progress through a series of tests, one test a week, from simpler to more complex tests (e.g., from t-test to multiple regression at the undergraduate level). Textbooks often mirror this structure, presenting one test per chapter.\nIn this approach, the presentation is often brief about the context: the question the researchers are investigating; the methods they use to collect data, including the measurements; and the assumptions they make about how your reasoning can get you from the things you measure to the things you are trying to understand. In this approach, also, example data may be presented in a limited, partial, way.\nThe reasons for this are understandable: methods are complex, technical, subjects for learning, and teachers and students do not also have time, perhaps, to think about statistics and about theoretical or measurement assumptions.\nThis is risky because it presents a misleading view of the challenge in learning methods: the misleading view is that the challenge is just the (difficult enough) challenge of learning about statistical methods, or dealing with numbers. It is risky, also, because it implies that if you learn the method, and can match the textbook example – the variables, the state of the data – when it is your turn to do an analysis, all will be well.\nA more productive approach – this is the approach we will take – is to expose, and talk about some of the real challenges that anybody who handles data, or quantitative evidence, in professional life. These challenges include:\n\nThinking about the mapping from our concerns to the research questions, to the things we measure, to analysis we do, and then the conclusions we make.\nSelecting or constructing valid measures that can be assumed to measure the things they are supposed to measure.\nTaking samples of observations, and making conclusions about the population.\nMaking estimates and linking these estimates to an account that is explicit about causes."

    "text": "Welcome to your overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in PSYC122 Week 16.\nWe will complete four classes in weeks 16-19. These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124.\nWe will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the Clearly understood project.\nWe encounter written health information all the time: in warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about. It is not always easy to understand this information. The problem is that it is unclear how health information should be communicated. As psychologists, we can help to improve health communication.\nWe will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this context will help you to make sense of the data, and to see why we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching.\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. This is to give you the opportunity to revise and consolidate your learning. We will extend your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.\nUltimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together. These new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future."

(You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)\nPart 1 of 4; about 15 minutes\nPart 2 of 4; about 11 minutes\nPart 3 of 4; about 22 minutes\nPart 4 of 4; about 11 minutes\nThe lecture is designed to give you an overview of:\n\nWhat we are doing in weeks 16-20, and how and why you will develop your critical thinking skills;\nA summary of the health communication project, and the ideas we assume to develop our hypotheses;\nHow we visualize and think about distributions and associations;\nAnd how we use R to estimate and test correlations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo work with the recordings:\n\nWatch the video parts right through.\nUse the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\nTry out the coding exercises in the how-to and the workbook (see Section 1.1.5.1) to see for yourself how you can construct visualizations and do analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Links to other classes\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\nThe lectures in PSYC123 on: (week 1) the scientific method; (week 2) reliability and validity; (week 3) experimental design, especially between-subjects studies; (week 6) hypothesis testing; and (week 9) precise hypotheses.\nThe lecture in PSYC122 on (week 11) correlation.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Pre-lab activity 1\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n\n\n\n1.1.3.1 Survey information\nThe survey asks you to:\n\ncomplete some questions about who you are;\nand then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.\n\nThe survey then asks you to:\n\nread five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;\nrespond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;\nand rate how well you think you understand the advice.\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. Some people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time.\nTaking part in the survey is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it. If you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).\nAll responses will be recorded completely anonymously.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Pre-lab activity 1 alternative\nIf you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the PSYC122 health advice research project.\nRead the project pre-registration\n\n\n1.1.5 Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\n1.1.5.1 Get your files ready\nDownload the 122-22-w16_for-students.zip files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server.\nThe folder includes data files:\n\nstudy-one-general-participants.csv\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv\n\nand the code files:\n\n2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R\n2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R\n\nAlternatively, you can instead download the resources you need from the module Moodle page for PSYC122:\nLink to Moodle\n\n\n1.1.5.2 What is in the how-to and workbook.R files?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou have been getting used to working with .R script files.\n\nNow our aim is to make sure you can work with code, and write notes in the files.\nIn the workbook you use for the lab activity, we identify tasks and questions, and leave you spaces where you can write code or answers.\n\n\n\nIn both the .R files:\n\n2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R\n2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R\n\nwe will take things step-by-step.\nWe split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions:\n\ndifferent parts for different phases of the analysis process;\ndifferent tasks for different steps in each phase;\ndifferent questions to examine different ideas or coding steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you start at the top of the .R file and work your way, in order, through each task.\nComplete each task before you move on to the next task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Review the how-to guide\nThe how-to guide comprises an .R file 2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R with code and advice. The code in the .R file was written to work with the data file:\n\nstudy-one-general-participants.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (Section 1.1.7) in the how-to guide.\n\nStart by looking at the how-to guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.7 Lab activity\nIn the lab activity .R file 2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics):\n\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv\n\nThe data are similar in format to the response data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project.\n\n1.1.7.1 Tasks\nIn the activity workbook, we are going to work through the following tasks.\n\nEmpty the R environment – using rm(list=ls())\nLoad relevant libraries – using library()\nRead in the data file – using read_csv()\nInspect the data – using head() and summary()\nChange the type classification of a variable in the data – using as.factor()\nDraw histograms to examine the distributions of variables – using ggplot() and geom_histogram()\nEdit the appearance of one variable histogram plot step-by-step\nDraw scatterplots to examine the associations between some variables – using ggplot() and geom_point()\nDraw scatterplots to examine different variables\nEdit the appearance of a plot step-by-step\nExamine associations between variables using correlation.\n\nThe activity 2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R file takes you through the tasks, one by one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, look at the advice in 2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R on what steps you have to follow, and examples on how to write the code.\n\n\nYou will see that you can match a task in the activity to the same task in the how-to. The how-to shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.\n\nDon’t forget: You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.\n\nThis process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science.\n\n\n1.1.7.2 What is in the data files\nEach of the data files we will work with has a similar structure, as you can see in this extract.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    participant_ID \n    mean.acc \n    mean.self \n    study \n    AGE \n    SHIPLEY \n    HLVA \n    FACTOR3 \n    QRITOTAL \n    GENDER \n    EDUCATION \n    ETHNICITY \n  \n \n\n  \n    studytwo.1 \n    0.4107143 \n    6.071429 \n    studytwo \n    26 \n    27 \n    6 \n    50 \n    9 \n    Female \n    Higher \n    Asian \n  \n  \n    studytwo.10 \n    0.6071429 \n    8.500000 \n    studytwo \n    38 \n    24 \n    9 \n    58 \n    15 \n    Female \n    Secondary \n    White \n  \n  \n    studytwo.100 \n    0.8750000 \n    8.928571 \n    studytwo \n    66 \n    40 \n    13 \n    60 \n    20 \n    Female \n    Higher \n    White \n  \n  \n    studytwo.101 \n    0.9642857 \n    8.500000 \n    studytwo \n    21 \n    31 \n    11 \n    59 \n    14 \n    Female \n    Higher \n    White \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the scroll bar at the bottom of the data window to view different columns.\nYou can see the columns:\n\nparticipant_ID participant code\nmean.acc average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance\nmean.self average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance\nstudy varianble coding for what study the data were collected in\nAGE age in years\nHLVA health literacy test score\nSHIPLEY vocabulary knowledge test score\nFACTOR3 reading strategy survey score\nGENDER gender code\nEDUCATION education level code\nETHNICITY ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to view the dataset – click on the name of the dataset in the R-Studio Environment window, and check out the columns, scroll through the rows – to get a sense of what you are working with.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.8 Answers\nYou will be able to download the answers version of the activity .R file in week 17. The answers version will present my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful."
